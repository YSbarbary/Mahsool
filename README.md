# Mahsool
Mahsool is a Mobile application to connect impact investors with smallfarmers

Agrochain, is a blockchain based transparent market place where the farmers and consumers could implement a co-operative farming method. Here, the farmers can list the potential crops and the expected yield on his farm on the distributed public ledger. The consumers can view the details and check for the farmer credibility based on the previous cultivation and supply. This creates a transparent and tamper-proof digital market platform for farm products. Thus an agreement (consensus) can be formed between farmer and consumer, such that the consumer can fund individual crops or a field and can acquire or the yield from the farm or the profit percentage of its market value. There will be a rating mechanism to build the credibility of farmer and consumer based on the previous experiences in the agromarket.

## Why Mahsool
It might take months to get their documents through the loan department of a bank, only to find out that their land title isn’t clear, and they can’t borrow. Their only choice is to turn to an expensive local loan shark for the necessary cash.

## What problems are we solving?

1- increase access to finance
2- increase profit
2- establish a digital identity of small farmers 
3- hashed on a blockchain and based on the existing paper ID documents of the farmers
his whole process also created another hidden benefit. Since the ownership of lands was established for farmers using their digital ID, banks and institutional micro-lenders started to offer loans to these smaller farmers, improving their lifestyle.
## How we used blockchain 
 lets them build smart contracts, trace and validate transactions and ownership rights, perform transactions through HARA tokens, and enables tokens to be traded on third-party token exchanges. The tokens incentivize the different parties in the system to participate, constantly building up a repository of valuable data. “Good information is the basis for good credit and goodwill. In our current economy, data is currency,” says Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon and a strong supporter of the project. 
## Why weo use block chain
Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts make a new level of crowdlending possible,
improving its security and transparency, thus enabling transactions between strangers. Costs are
significantly reduced, and transparency is higher by transferring Ethereum compatible tokens
directly from investors’ to borrower’s wallets without financial intermediaries; A decentralized
system giving rise to true international crowdlending, and also allowing for risk diversification:
investing small tickets in multiple projects.

## Steps 
### Step 1 – Lender creates a profile
A lender could create a profile with the information including:
•	Personal Information (Name, Address, and ID number)
•	Bank Account Information
•	Type of Investment a lender wants to make. For example, a lender might wish to lend money to the borrowers requesting a loan for the business purposes.
•	Criteria for different types of borrower, i.e., setting up the rate of interests according to the worthiness of a borrower.
The profile is submitted to the marketplace where lenders and borrowers could find each other.
### Step 2 – Lender waits for the loan requests
Once the account is successfully created, lender waits for the loan requests from the borrower. As soon as any request is received, the lender schedules an interview with the borrower.
### Step 3 – Borrower creates an account
A borrower setups an account with the following information:
•	Personal Information including name, address, and government-approved ID
•	Collateral- Crypto-coins, legal documents, and a guarantor.
### Step 4 – Borrower sends a request for the loan
After creating the account successfully, a borrower can send the loan request to all lenders around the world. Smart contracts allow borrowers to send loan requests to the lenders who are interested in the type of investment a borrower wants to make.
### Step 5 – Lender interviews the borrower
After receiving the loan request, a lender interviews borrower and asks the following questions:
•	Why do you want to take the loan?
•	What is your monthly earning?
•	What is your repayment rate?
•	How many times have you applied for the credit in history?
A lender can either approve or reject the loan application based on the above questions.
### Step 6 – Smart Contract fixes the rate of interest
If the lender approves the loan request, the smart contract decides the fixed rate of interest for different types of borrowers by checking their creditworthiness.
The borrowers can be categorized as high-risk, medium-risk or low-risk borrowers based on their repayment rates.
For example, lenders can set the low rate of interest for a low-risk borrower having good repayment rate.
Using  Lending Blockchain Platform, the rate of interests remain fixed all over the world.
