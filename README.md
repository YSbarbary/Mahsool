# Why Mahsool
It might take months to get their documents through the loan department of a bank, only to find out that their land title isn’t clear, and they can’t borrow. Their only choice is to turn to an expensive local loan shark for the necessary cash.

1- increase access to finance
2- establish a digital identity of small farmers 
3- hashed on a blockchain and based on the existing paper ID documents of the farmers
his whole process also created another hidden benefit. Since the ownership of lands was established for farmers using their digital ID, banks and institutional micro-lenders started to offer loans to these smaller farmers, improving their lifestyle.
# How we used blockchain 
 lets them build smart contracts, trace and validate transactions and ownership rights, perform transactions through HARA tokens, and enables tokens to be traded on third-party token exchanges. The tokens incentivize the different parties in the system to participate, constantly building up a repository of valuable data. “Good information is the basis for good credit and goodwill. In our current economy, data is currency,” says Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon and a strong supporter of the project.
