# Mahsool

Mahsool is crowd-lending platform that increase access to highly profitable projects with positive impact, by directly connecting investors to projects rated by risk level.

Mahsool is a Blockchain-based platform connects lenders with profitable small farmers around Egypt. Mahsool empower small farmers with increasing there access to financial resources and accses to market, connecting lenders to solvent projects. It offers a wide portfolio of investment opportunities, listed upon its risk ratings and at the same time allows access to small producers which are an important part of the 2 billion yet excluded, and thus achieving benefits for both parts: That’s what we call Positive Impact Lending.


## What problems are we solving?
Mahsool enables small Farmers from Egypt to access loans at much lower rates than the ones now available to them. Meaning both parties benefit from this exchange.


### 1- increase access to finance
### 2- increase profit
### 3- establish a digital identity of small farmers 
### 4- hashed on a blockchain and based on the existing paper ID documents of the farmers
his whole process also created another hidden benefit. Since the ownership of lands was established for farmers using their digital ID, banks and institutional micro-lenders started to offer loans to these smaller farmers, improving their lifestyle.

## How we used blockchain 
 lets them build smart contracts, trace and validate transactions and ownership rights, perform transactions through HARA tokens, and enables tokens to be traded on third-party token exchanges. The tokens incentivize the different parties in the system to participate, constantly building up a repository of valuable data. “Good information is the basis for good credit and goodwill. In our current economy, data is currency,” says Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon and a strong supporter of the project. 
 
## Why weo use block chain
Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts make a new level of crowdlending possible,
improving its security and transparency, thus enabling transactions between strangers. Costs are
significantly reduced, and transparency is higher by transferring Ethereum compatible tokens
directly from investors’ to borrower’s wallets without financial intermediaries; A decentralized
system giving rise to true international crowdlending, and also allowing for risk diversification:
investing small tickets in multiple projects.

## Framework
we now using hyperledger but aims to use ethereum

Setting `HL_COMPOSER_CLI` to the actual version of composer you want will ensure it used. For example for a local install follow this

```bash
$ npm install composer-cli
$ # install locally to the node_modules directory of this packge
$ export HL_COMPOSER_CLI=$(npm bin)/composer
$ # this will now use the local version

### Step 1 – Lender creates a profile
A lender could create a profile with the information including:
•	Personal Information (Name, Address, and ID number)
•	Bank Account Information
•	Type of Investment a lender wants to make. For example, a lender might wish to lend money to the borrowers requesting a loan for the business purposes.
•	Criteria for different types of borrower, i.e., setting up the rate of interests according to the worthiness of a borrower.
The profile is submitted to the marketplace where lenders and borrowers could find each other.
### Step 2 – Lender waits for the loan requests
Once the account is successfully created, lender waits for the loan requests from the borrower. As soon as any request is received, the lender schedules an interview with the borrower.
### Step 3 – Borrower creates an account
A borrower setups an account with the following information:
•	Personal Information including name, address, and government-approved ID
•	Collateral- Crypto-coins, legal documents, and a guarantor.
### Step 4 – Borrower sends a request for the loan
After creating the account successfully, a borrower can send the loan request to all lenders around the world. Smart contracts allow borrowers to send loan requests to the lenders who are interested in the type of investment a borrower wants to make.
### Step 5 – Lender interviews the borrower
After receiving the loan request, a lender interviews borrower and asks the following questions:
•	Why do you want to take the loan?
•	What is your monthly earning?
•	What is your repayment rate?
•	How many times have you applied for the credit in history?
A lender can either approve or reject the loan application based on the above questions.
### Step 6 – Smart Contract fixes the rate of interest
If the lender approves the loan request, the smart contract decides the fixed rate of interest for different types of borrowers by checking their creditworthiness.
The borrowers can be categorized as high-risk, medium-risk or low-risk borrowers based on their repayment rates.
For example, lenders can set the low rate of interest for a low-risk borrower having good repayment rate.
Using  Lending Blockchain Platform, the rate of interests remain fixed all over the world.
